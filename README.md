# DictionaryApp
A simple Dictionary project developed using Node.js. The application queries the Oxford dictionary api for words which it doesn't know already and stores the word along with it's definition in a trie data structure. The words, which the application is already familiar with, can be retrieved from the trie data structure at a significantly shorter duration than the Oxford api call.
